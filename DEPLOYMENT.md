### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Backend API running on `https://localhost:7001`

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Access at http://localhost:5173
```

### Build & Deploy
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Deploy dist/ folder to your hosting service
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://localhost:7001/api
VITE_SIGNALR_HUB_URL=https://localhost:7001/gameHub
VITE_ENABLE_DEVTOOLS=true
```

### Backend Requirements
Ensure your backend API provides these endpoints:
- `POST /api/players` - Player registration
- `GET /api/games` - List games
- `POST /api/games` - Create game
- `POST /api/games/{id}/join` - Join game
- `GET /api/games/{id}` - Get game details
- `GET /api/choices` - Get available choices
- `POST /api/games/{gameId}/choices` - Make choice
- SignalR Hub at `/gameHub`

## 🎮 Game Flow

1. **Player Registration** - Enter name to create player profile
2. **Game Lobby** - View available games or create new one
3. **Join Game** - Click to join available games
4. **Gameplay** - Make choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard)
5. **Results** - View round and final game results
6. **Real-time Updates** - All players see updates instantly

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Dark/Light Themes** - Toggle between themes
- **Loading States** - Spinners and progress indicators
- **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages

- **Optimized bundle** - ~588KB gzipped for production
- **Modern best practices** - Hooks, functional components, proper error boundaries

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Test with backend**: Ensure backend API is running
3. **Play test**: Register players and test full game flow
4. **Customize**: Adjust themes, add features, or modify UI
5. **Deploy**: Build and deploy to your hosting platform

## 🎯 Ready for Production!

The application is fully functional and ready for:
- Local development and testing
- Backend integration
